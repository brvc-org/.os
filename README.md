# .os
The ability to port and run an operating system on the blockchain, via a browser

The ability to completely ‘port’ an operating system to the Blockchain/Hyperledger
i.e., Win9x → Blockchain
WinXP, 7, 8.1, 10/11 → Blockchain
WinServ 2003+ → Blockchain
Linux, Ubuntu, Unix, macOS (?)
- What about the ability to incorporate past distros, releases as domain names?
i.e., .winxp, .windows7, .windows2000
and then run them as cmdlets?
- Windows PowerShell ran from within a Blockchain-like ‘docker,’ responding to PowerShell-like command/requests from w/in a Python console, ran from within a Node Operator-like environment…
- Bitcoin PowerShell
- Blockchain PowerShell
- A Blockchain-hosted OS, ran within a browser, via .windows domain name?
BlockchainOS
- BlockchainOS – kind of like ChromOS (?)
- .os as a domain name extension?
- .operatingsystem
- ipfs://$bitcoin
- Inner-blockchain transfers perhaps just like inner-operating-system Windows command, only for Bitcoin/crypto environment, its tokenized transfer(s)?
i.e., RUN command: ipfs://$Bamount_destination_hash
- Layers of Blockchain-like environments ran as, each layer, as a different/past distribution of a certain OS, or a combination of 4 or 5 or 6 or 7…
Layer 1: XP
Layer 2: 7
Layer 3: 8.1
Layer 4: 10
Layer 5: 11…
—
Layer 1: 2003
Layer 2: 2008 (R1/2)
Layer 3: 2012
Layer 4: 2016
Layer5: 2019…
- .windowsserver2003, .winserv03
- .windowsserver2016, .winserv16
- .googlechrome
- .gcloudx
- .azurecloud
- .azurecloudx
- …What would the file formats, if any, look like in a BlockchainOS environment???
- .py ran through WinPowerShell cmdlet, parsed through NodeShell?
- Swift via Python ran through BlockchainOS environ?
- What if BlockchainOS/web3/5 were to institute entire-whole replacement of https://www. with, simply, ‘.’
.address.blockchain.
- Symbol/ASCII characters as domain/URL extension(s) (?)
- .arc
- arc.example.b
- arc.example.blockchain
- arc.example.btc
- ‘arc’ as the antecedent (kind of like the prefix usually associated with regular URLs/domain-names) to the, what would normally be thought of as, ‘typical’ web3/5 address/URL
- ‘arc’ as kind of a call-back-to/inspired-by original ‘alt.’ of USENETs/SUBNETS/Local WORKGROUPs…
- .ux
- .ui
- .gfx
- .material
- arc.xxx.extension
- arc.example.material [(html/xml, ajax, js+py call-function/command for reverse/contra-recursion, so as to call-back the complete, foremost antecedent/(or, first logical antonym, in a sense)] for the ‘extension’ of the web3/5 URL/domain-name/postscript, per se… kind of sort of like the get-function for HTML browser behavior… CSS/PHP (4 < (?)) possible?... HTML5 as complete replacement so as/due to graphical frame-rate “exploit”-ability, compiling and executing and running multi-/different run-time and coding environs/languages at once… all in one same page/browser window/session?....

- .31
- .unix
- .apple
